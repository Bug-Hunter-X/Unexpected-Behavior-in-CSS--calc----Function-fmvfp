# Unexpected Behavior in CSS `calc()` Function

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the CSS `calc()` function.  The `calc()` function, while powerful, can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully.  The examples here highlight the issues of spacing, operator precedence, and data type inconsistencies.

**Issues Covered:**

* Incorrect order of operations leading to unexpected calculations.
* Errors from mixing incompatible data types within the calculation.

**Solutions:**
* Pay close attention to spacing within `calc()` expressions.
* Carefully plan the order of operations, perhaps breaking down complex calculations into simpler steps.
* Ensure all units and data types within the calculation are compatible.
