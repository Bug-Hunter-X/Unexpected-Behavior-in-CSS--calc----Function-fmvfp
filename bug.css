The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there are some unexpected behaviors that can occur when using the `calc()` function, especially when dealing with different units or complex expressions.  For example, sometimes spaces around operators are important, and sometimes they're not, and not following exact syntax rules can lead to unexpected results.  Another common issue is the incorrect order of operations.  CSS doesn't follow the standard mathematical order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), so unexpected results may be obtained when expressions are more complicated. This can be especially tricky with nested `calc()` expressions.  Also, ensure that you are not mixing different data types in your calculations; you may encounter parsing errors if you try to combine percentages, lengths, and other units incorrectly.
